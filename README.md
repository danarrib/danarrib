âš¡ Fun fact: I love RC aircraft (Model airplanes and FPV drones). So I made a ground control station system to use with my aircrafts, which is [BulletGCSS](https://github.com/danarrib/BulletGCSS). It's a software that sends aircraft telemetry data over the cellular network to the aircraft operator.
