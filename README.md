### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel Ribeiro

#### Full Stack / Full Cycle developer from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I have +20 years making all kinds of software, specially software for Web.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Cinema tickets seller system, which will be capable of handling very heavy peaks of incoming traffic.
The goal is to survive to a "Spyder Man - No way home" premiere demand... Means +10K transactions per hour.

The purpose of this project is to learn some technologies that I still don't know:
- Use of Docker containers and micro services architecture
- Use KeyCloak for Authentication and Authorization (OpenID Connect + OAuth2)
- React for the "Home" front-end
- Vue.js for the "Checkout" front-end
- Angular for the "Backoffice" front-end
- RabbitMQ
- MongoDB
- Memcached
- Automated testing
- Azure and/or AWS

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [KeyCloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak), [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq), [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb) and [Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached).

âœ¨ I already know:
- HTML, Javascript, CSS
- Bootstrap, jQuery (old stuff, I know)
- C# .NET Framework
- C# .NET Core 3.1
- ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core
- MS SQL Server
- A lot of other old tech
- Some basic Arduino and ESP32 (C and C++) programming

ðŸ“« How to reach me: danarrib@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: I love RC aircraft (Model airplanes and FPV drones). So I made a ground control station system to use with my aircrafts, which is [BulletGCSS](https://github.com/danarrib/BulletGCSS). It's a software that sends aircraft telemetry data over the cellular network to the aircraft operator.
